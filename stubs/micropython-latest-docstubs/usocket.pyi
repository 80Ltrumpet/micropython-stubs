        **Note**: Not every port supports this method, see below.

        Set a timeout on blocking socket operations. The value argument can be a nonnegative floating

        will raise an `OSError` exception if the timeout period value has elapsed before the operation has
        completed. If zero is given, the socket is put in non-blocking mode. If None is given, the socket
        is put in blocking mode.

        Not every :term:`MicroPython port` supports this method. A more portable and
        generic solution is to use `select.poll` object. This allows to wait on
        multiple objects at the same time (and not just on sockets, but on generic
        `stream` objects which support polling). Example::
